# Password-Manager
A password manager from scrap


Password Manager

Main Objectives:

GUI
Preferably implemented in Python (more experience with Python), otherwise in C++.
Encryption
RSA with public and private keys and a password for accessing the GUI.
Data Storage and Search Algorithm
Store data in a .txt or .md file.
Implement a search algorithm using Boyer-Moore.
Secondary Objectives:

Password Generation
Allow users to specify requirements (e.g., special characters, numbers, etc.).
Use an algorithm based on the system time to generate passwords of a specified length.
Optional: Web Scraping for Leaks
If time permits, implement web scraping to check if any leaks have occurred.
Quite complex—perhaps there’s an open-source API suitable for this purpose.
